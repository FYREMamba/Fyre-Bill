# FYRE Bill Platform
## Executive Business Brief

---

### The Problem
**Civic participation in America is broken.** Despite having constitutional rights to petition government and propose legislation, ordinary citizens face insurmountable barriers:

- **Complexity Barrier**: Legal language and legislative procedures are intentionally opaque
- **Access Barrier**: Professional bill drafting costs thousands of dollars
- **Knowledge Barrier**: Most citizens don't understand their rights or the legislative process
- **Connection Barrier**: Finding and effectively communicating with representatives is difficult
- **Professional Barrier**: Amateur-looking proposals get dismissed immediately

**Result**: Only wealthy individuals, corporations, and special interests can effectively participate in lawmaking.
